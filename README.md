# Smart Parking System

## Overview
The Smart Parking System is designed to optimize urban parking management using ESP32 and Arduino microcontrollers. It integrates real-time occupancy detection, a user-friendly mobile interface, and reservation capabilities to improve efficiency and user convenience.

## Features
- **Real-time Parking Detection:** Utilizes IR sensors to detect parking space occupancy and relays data to microcontrollers.
- **User Interface:** Developed using MIT App Inventor, allowing users to check available parking spots.
- **Reservation System:** Enables users to book parking spaces in advance.
- **Remote Access & Connectivity:** Leverages ESP32â€™s Wi-Fi capabilities for real-time updates and mobile access.

## Hardware Used
- ESP32 Microcontroller
- IR Sensors
- Arduino Microcontroller

## Software & Tools
- Arduino IDE
- MIT App Inventor
- Embedded C/C++

## Installation & Setup
1. **Hardware Setup:** Connect IR sensors to ESP32 and position them in parking spots.
2. **Firmware Upload:** Program the ESP32 and Arduino using the Arduino IDE.
3. **Mobile App Deployment:** Install the MIT App Inventor-based app on a smartphone.
4. **Network Configuration:** Connect ESP32 to a Wi-Fi network for remote access.

## Usage
- Open the mobile app to check parking availability.
- Reserve a parking space in advance.
- Drive to the allocated space, where sensors confirm occupancy.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating a payment system for seamless transactions.
- Implementing AI-based analytics for parking demand prediction.
- Expanding to support multiple parking lots in a centralized system.
